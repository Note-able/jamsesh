## To run
Clone git repository
navigate to directory and run `npm install`
modify your hostfile to have localhost changed to local.jamsesh.com (you can just add another field for 127.0.0.1)
run `npm run start-dev`
from here on if you have any style changes or changes to public info you can just run `npm run styles` and then `npm run start` to shortcut the bundling.
